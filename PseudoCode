// Pseudocode

read text from file into string

function countWords(text segment) {
    // count words in the segment
}


// If I didn't get him wrong he wanted the program to continuously run through each thread instead of finishing and having to be manually started again
for each threadCount in [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] {
    start timer
    divide text into threadCount segments
    create and start threadCount threads, each running countWords on a segment
    wait for all threads to complete
    end timer and record time taken

    print time taken for this thread count
}

// (Optional) Print word counts for verification
